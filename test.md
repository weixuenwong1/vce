# **Generators and Alternators**

In power plants — like **coal, gas, nuclear, hydro**, and **wind** — turbines spin coils inside magnetic fields, producing electricity. This process of **converting mechanical motion into electrical energy** is exactly what a **generator** does.


## **Alternators**
Alternators look quite similar to the **DC motors** we've studied, but they work **in reverse**.

Instead of **using electrical energy** to make the coil spin, **alternators** convert **rotational energy** (e.g. from a spinning turbine or crankshaft) into **electrical energy**.

- A coil is **rotated** within a magnetic field.
- A changing flux through the coil induces an **emf**, producing current.
- The output is connected to a device like an **oscilloscope**, which displays an **emf vs. time graph**.

---

#### ***Why Alternating Current (AC) is Produced***

As the coil spins within the magnetic field:
- The **magnetic flux** through the coil changes continuously.
- Using **Lenz’s Law**, we see that the **induced current** must continuously adjust to oppose the changing flux.
- This results in an **alternating current**, as the **direction of current reverses** every **180°** of rotation.

>To maintain a connection with the rotating coil:
> - **Slip rings** are used — each one attached to a different end of the coil.
> - Unlike the split-ring commutator in DC motors, slip rings **don't** switch the direction of current **manually.**
> - This ensures the **emf reverses polarity** each half-turn, generating a continuous **AC output.**

## **DC Generators**
**DC generators** operate almost identically to **alternators**, with **one key difference:**
They use a **split-ring commutator** instead of **slip rings**.

The **split-ring commutator** reverses the connection to the external circuit **every 180°** and ensures that the **current direction in the external circuit remains the same**

<br>

This is the key distinction between:
>- **Alternators** (with slip rings) → produce **AC**
>- **DC generators** (with split-ring commutators) → produce **DC**

#### ***Comparing Outputs: Alternator vs. DC Generator***

Using the same **flux vs. time graph**:

![Flux-Time Graph](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/FluxTime.png)

The diagrams below show the resulting **emf outputs** for an **alternator** and a **DC generator**:

![Outputs](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/AlternatorVsGenerator.png)

- When the **flux starts at a maximum**, the **emf starts at zero**.  
- When the **flux starts at zero**, the **emf starts at a maximum**.  
  ➤ This is because emf is the **gradient** of the flux-time graph

Let's consider alternator and DC generator problems below.

**e.g 1. Figure A below illustrates a simple DC generator with a magnetic field of 0.40 T. The loop has 100 turns and the area of the loop is 0.060 m². The rate of rotation is 50 Hz.**

![DC Generator Problem](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/DCGen2.2.png)
**a) Determine the period of the loop's rotation. (1 mark)**

$$ T = \frac{1}{f} $$
$$ T = \frac{1}{50} $$
$$ T = 0.02 \; s $$

---

🎯 Period is the **time taken to complete one full rotation (s)**, while frequency is the **number of rotations per second (Hz).**

---

<br>

**b) Calculate the magnitude of the average EMF induced as the loop completes a quarter of one revolution. Show your working. (2 marks)**

$$\mathcal{E}= N\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} $$

$$\Delta \Phi = \Phi_f - \Phi_i $$
$$\Delta \Phi = B_{\perp}A - 0 $$
$$\Delta \Phi = 0.40 \cdot 0.060 - 0 $$
$$\Delta \Phi = 0.024 $$

$$\Delta t = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 0.02 $$
$$\Delta t = 0.005 $$

$$\mathcal{E} = 100 \cdot \frac{0.024}{0.005} $$
$$\mathcal{E} = 480 \; V $$

---

We apply **Faraday’s Law** here

***(You can ignore the negative sign cause we're mostly interested in the magnitude)***

**Calculate the change in flux**  
$$
\Delta \Phi = \Phi_{\text{final}} - \Phi_{\text{initial}}
$$

- **Initial flux** is **zero** (coil is parallel to the field lines).  
- **Final flux** is **maximum** (coil is perpendicular), so use:  
  $$
  \Phi = BA
  $$

2. **Determine the time taken for the change**  
If the coil rotates a **quarter turn**, the time is:  
$$
\Delta t = \frac{T}{4}
$$

> Note: If your answer for emf comes out **negative**, you can just use the **positive value**

**c) On the given axis, sketch the voltage output of the DC generator for two complete revolutions. Label only time intervals on the T-axis. (3 marks)**

![EMF-Time Graph](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/solution_media/DCGen2.2ANS.png)

---

The induced emf starts at a maximum value. Current is **rectified** every 180° by the split-ring commutator, the emf and current alternate direction, and **only one side of the T-axis is observed**. **One complete revolution takes 0.02 s.**

---

**e.g 2. A rotating coil alternator consists of a rectangular loop measuring 5.0 × 10⁻³ m × 2.0 × 10⁻³ m with 100 turns positioned within a uniform 8.0 × 10⁻³ T magnetic field. The coil completes one full rotation every 0.02 s.**

![Alternator](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Alternator2.1.png)

**a) If the coil JKLM rotates anti-clockwise as viewed from the side of the slip rings, determine whether the current in side KL flows from K to L or L to K during the first quarter turn. Provide your reasoning. (3 marks)**

***The direction of the induced current through side KL is from L to K. As the coil rotates in an anticlockwise direction, the flux through the loop directed to the right increases. According to Lenz’s Law, to oppose this change, a current is induced such that its magnetic flux through the loop is directed to the left, resulting in current flowing from L to K.***

---
**Note:** The question specifically asked for the current during a **quarter turn** of the coil.  

Beyond this point, the **direction of the induced current will reverse**, since an **alternator naturally produces alternating current (AC)** as the coil continues to rotate.

![Flux Time Graph](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/DCGen5.2.png)

**b) On the grid provided above, sketch the flux versus time output of the graph for two complete revolutions as the coil begins to rotate. Label the horizontal axis with scales and mark the peaks on the flux axis. (3 marks)**

![Flux Time Graph Answer](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/FluxTimeAnswer.png)

---

To find the **maximum magnetic flux** through the coil, use the formula, $$\Phi = BA$$. The period is given as **0.02 s**, and as shown in **Figure A**, the flux starts from **0 Wb**.


---

![EMF Time Graph](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Flux5.3.png)

**c) The graph above displays the EMF output versus time for two complete revolutions.**

**The following changes were made to the configuration of the alternator.**

**- Frequency of rotation is doubled**
**- Strength of the magnetic field is halved.**

**Sketch, on the same set of axis, the resulting flux versus time graph after these changes are made for two complete revolutions with a dotted line. (3 marks)**

![EMF Time Graph](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/EMFTimeAnswer.png)


---

Doubling the **frequency** means the **period is halved**, so the coil completes one rotation in **half the original time**. This also results in the **emf doubling**, since emf is proportional to the **rate of change of flux**.
However, **halving the magnetic field strength** also **halves the emf**. So, doubling the frequency and halving the field strength **cancel each other out** — the overall **magnitude of the emf remains unchanged**.

---

## **Peak and RMS Values**

The output of an alternator (EMF vs time) follows a **sinusoidal waveform**. While the waveform reaches **peak values** (maximum amplitude), it's often more practical to refer to its **RMS (Root Mean Square) value**, which represents an **effective or average voltage.**

![Australia AC mains power](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/AustraliaAC.png)


- The **RMS value** is calculated by:
  
  $$
  V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}
  $$

- The **Peak-to-Peak value** is:

  $$
  V_{\text{peak-peak}} = 2 \cdot V_{\text{peak}}
  $$

- In **Australia**, the standard mains power supply is **230 V RMS at 50 Hz**.

> An RMS voltage is equivalent to a **constant DC voltage** that would produce the **same power output.**

##  **Conclusion for Generators and Alternators**

Both **generators** and **alternators** rely on the principle of **electromagnetic induction**, converting **mechanical (rotational) energy** into **electrical energy** by rotating a coil within a magnetic field.

- In an **alternator**, the use of **slip rings** allows the induced emf to **alternate naturally**, producing an **alternating current (AC)** that reverses direction every half-turn.
  
- In contrast, a **DC generator** uses a **split-ring commutator** to reverse the coil's connections every 180°, ensuring that the current in the **external circuit always flows in one direction**, resulting in a **direct current (DC)** output.
