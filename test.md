# **Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity**




We will now discuss the topic of **special relativity**, a theory that revolutionised our understanding of space, time, and motion. Einstein proposed that **time and space are not fixed**, but adjust themselves to keep the **speed of light constant for all observers,** leading to the phenomena of  **time dilation** and **length contraction.**


---


## Special Relativity


We first need to understand that **all motion is relative,** except for the speed of light. **Nobody can measure something without making reference to something else.**


>For example, consider the scenario below:
>
>- **Person A** is driving at **50 km/h** relative to the ground.
>- **Person B** is standing still on the side of the road and uses a speed gun to measure Person A‚Äôs speed as **50 km/h**.
>
>However:
>
>- **Person C** is driving towards Person A at **50 km/h** in the opposite direction.
>- From Person C‚Äôs perspective, **Person A‚Äôs speed appears to be 100 km/h**, because their speeds add up relative to each other.






Despite everything appearing relative, there are **two things that remain constant**, given as **Einstein‚Äôs postulates**:


1. **The laws of physics are the same in all inertial reference frames.**
2. **The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and absolute.**


---


### ***Michelson-Morley experiment***


Einstein's second postulate is supported by the **Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment.**


The Michelson-Morley experiment tested for the existence of the hypothesised luminiferous aether by detecting any changes in the speed of light due to the movement of Earth through the aether. However, there are no changes detected which implied that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames.

## ‚è≥ Time Dilation


**Time measured in the rest frame** (where the clock is stationary relative to the observer) is always **shorter** than the time measured from an **external frame** when the object is moving. This results in:


$$
   \boldsymbol{t = \gamma t_0}
$$


Where:
- **$ t $** = dilated time (s) ***- time interval measured by an observer for whom the clock is moving***
- **$ t_0 $** = proper time (s) ***- time interval measured in the clock‚Äôs own rest frame***
- **$ \gamma $** = Lorentz factor $ (\boldsymbol{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}})  $




The **Lorentz factor** is always **greater than 1**, hence **dilated time (t)** is always **longer** (stretched) compared to **proper time (t‚ÇÄ)**.


---


## üìè Length Contraction


**Length measured in the rest frame** (where the object is stationary) is always **longer** than the length measured from an **external frame** when the object is moving. This results in:


$$
   \boldsymbol{L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma}}
$$


Where:
- **$ L $** = contracted length (m) ***- length measured by an observer for whom the object is moving***
- **$ L_0 $** = proper length (m) ***- length measured in the object's own rest frame***
- **$ \gamma $** = Lorentz factor $ (\boldsymbol{\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}})  $




The **Lorentz factor ($ \gamma $)** is always **greater than 1**, hence **contracted length (L)** is always **shorter** than the **proper length (L‚ÇÄ)**.


---


### ***Application of Special Relativity***




Muons are particles produced high in the **upper atmosphere** where most muons are expected to **decay before reaching Earth‚Äôs surface** due to their short half-lives. However, many are detected at ground level,  something that can only be explained using **special relativity**.




***Perspective of the muons:***


- The **Earth is moving towards them** at a high speed. 
- They observe **length contraction**, where the **distance from their position in the atmosphere to Earth‚Äôs surface is shorter** than what scientists on Earth measure. 
- Thus, they can reach the surface **before decaying**.


***Perspective of the scientists (Earth frame):***


- Muons are moving towards them at **high speeds**. 
- Due to **time dilation**, the muons‚Äô **half-lives are dilated**. 
- This means muons take **longer to decay**, allowing **more of them to reach the surface** than classical physics predicts.

<br>


Let's consider the problem below.


<br>




**e.g 1. An interstellar spacecraft, Orion, travels from Earth to a star system 9.0 light-years away, as measured by observers on Earth. The spacecraft moves at 0.8c relative to Earth.**


<br>


**a) Calculate the Lorentz factor (Œ≥) for the spacecraft‚Äôs journey. (1 mark)**
$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} $$


$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.8c)^2}{c^2}}} $$


$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.8)^2}} $$


$$ \therefore \; \gamma = 1.667 $$


---


<br>


**b) How long does the journey take according to observers on Earth? Show your working. (2 marks)**
$$ t = \frac{d}{v} $$


$$t = \frac{9.0 \; \text{ly}}{0.8c} $$


$$t = 11.25 \; \text{years} $$


---


From **Earth‚Äôs perspective**, the distance is **9.0 light-years** (proper length) and the spacecraft travels at **0.8c**, so they measure the journey time as **11.25 years**.


---


<br>


**c) How long does the journey take according to astronauts on the spacecraft? Show your working. (2 marks)**


$$ t_0 = \frac{t}{\gamma} $$


$$ \frac{11.25}{1.667} = 6.75 \; \text{years} $$


---


This is **proper time**, as the astronauts are at rest relative to themselves during the journey. They experience **less time passing.**


---


<br>


**d)  What distance does the spacecraft crew measure between Earth and the star system during the journey? Explain your answer with working. (2 marks)**


$$ L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma} $$


$$L = \frac{9.0}{1.667} $$


$$L =  5.4 \; \text{light-years} $$


---


From the **astronauts‚Äô perspective**, the star system is moving towards them at **0.8c**. Due to **length contraction**, they measure the distance to be **shorter (5.4 ly)**, making the journey take less time at their observed speed.


> - **Earth‚Äôs frame:** Proper length, dilated time. 
> - **Astronauts‚Äô frame:** Proper time, contracted length.

## Einstein's Relationship between Mass and Energy


Einstein‚Äôs theory showed that **mass is a form of energy**, captured by **E = mc¬≤**, meaning that if work is done on an object to increase its energy, its mass also increases. However, because **c¬≤ is so large**, these changes in mass are usually too small to notice in everyday life.


Both **kinetic energy and mass are relative and interconnected**, depending on the observer‚Äôs frame of reference; as an object moves faster relative to an observer, its **kinetic energy and measured mass increase**.


An object at rest has its **rest mass ($\boldsymbol{m_0}$)**, while its mass measured from a **frame where it is moving is greater**, given by:


$$
   \boldsymbol{m = \gamma m_0}
$$


Where:
- $m$ = relativistic mass (kg)
- $m_0$ = rest mass (kg)
- $ \gamma $ = Lorentz factor




The **total energy** of an object is:


$$ E_\text{total} = mc^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2 $$


As:


$$ E_\text{total} = E_k + E_\text{rest} $$


So,


$$ E_k = E_\text{total} - E_\text{rest} $$


$$
   \therefore \; E_k = (\gamma - 1) m_0 c^2
$$


---


‚úÖ **Key point:** For **high speeds approaching the speed of light**, the traditional kinetic energy formula **$ \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $** underestimates the true energy, and the **relativistic form** must be used.


---


<br>


Let's consider the problem below.


<br>


**e.g 2. A proton has a rest mass of 1.67 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤‚Å∑ kg and is moving at 0.60c. Calculate its relativistic kinetic energy and total energy. Use c = 3.00 √ó 10‚Å∏ m s‚Åª¬π.(3 marks)**
$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.95)^2}} $$ \
$$ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9025}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0975}} $$ \
$$ \gamma = 3.20 $$


$$ E_\text{k} = (\gamma - 1) m_0 c^2 $$ \
$$ E_\text{k} = (3.20 - 1) \cdot (1.67 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (3.00 \times 10^8)^2 $$ \
$$ E_\text{k} = 3.31 \times 10^{-10} \; \text{J} $$


$$ E_\text{tot} = \gamma m_0 c^2 $$ \
$$ E_\text{tot} = 3.20 \cdot (1.67 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (3.00 \times 10^8)^2 $$ \
$$ E_\text{tot} = 4.81 \times 10^{-10} \; \text{J} $$

## Conclusion for Einstein‚Äôs Theory of Special Relativity


Einstein‚Äôs special relativity fundamentally changed our understanding of **space, time, and energy**. It showed that **time and length are not absolute**, but instead depend on the **relative motion** between observers. Moving clocks run slower (**time dilation**), and moving objects contract in length along the direction of motion (**length contraction**), ensuring the **speed of light remains constant in all inertial frames**.


The theory is built upon two postulates:
1. The **laws of physics are the same** in all inertial reference frames.
2. The **speed of light in a vacuum is constant** for all observers, regardless of their relative motion.


These ideas were supported by experimental evidence such as the **Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment** and observations like muons reaching Earth‚Äôs surface due to relativistic effects.


Additionally, special relativity revealed the relationship between **mass and energy** ($ E = mc^2 $), implying that mass is a form of energy and that as an object‚Äôs speed increases, so does its **relativistic mass and total energy**.
