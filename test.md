# **Light as a Wave**




In Unit 4, we dive into the topic of light. One of the central debates we examine is the nature of light‚Äî**what is light, really?** Is it a wave, a particle, or something else entirely?


We begin by investigating the idea of **light as a wave** but we'll first need to build a solid understanding of **waves and their key properties**, as well as the various **phenomena** associated with wave behaviour.

### ***Displacement‚ÄìTime Graphs***


This type of graph provides information about the **period (T)** of a wave. 
Imagine focusing on a single point on a slinky. As the wave passes through the slinky, that particle moves **up and down repeatedly** when the slinky is shaken at regular intervals.

![Displacement-Time Graphs](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Displacement-Time+Graph.png)


The graph above shows how that particle‚Äôs **displacement changes over time**. 
From this, we can determine the **time it takes to complete one full cycle**‚Äîthe **period (s)**.


---


### ***Displacement‚ÄìDistance Graphs***


This graph provides information about the **wavelength (Œª)** of a wave. 
It‚Äôs like taking a snapshot of the entire slinky at one moment in time, showing the **position of all particles** along its length. Some particles are at peaks, others at troughs and some centered. 


![Displacement-Time Graphs](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Displacement-Distance+Graph.png)


By measuring the **distance between successive points** in the same phase (e.g. peak to peak), we find the **wavelength (m)**.



By combining information from both graphs:


- **Wavelength (Œª)** is the **distance** between repeating points
- **Period (T)** is the **time** between repeating motion at one point


We can calculate the **speed** of the wave using:


$$
\boldsymbol{\text{v} = \frac{\lambda \; (\text{distance})}{T \; (\text{time})} = f\lambda }
$$


as $ f = \frac{1}{T} $ where **$ f $** is the **frequency** of the wave (Hz) .

<br>


Let's consider the problem below.


<br>


**e.g 1. A sinusoidal wave of wavelength 0.80 m is travelling along a string with a constant speed 80 m s‚Åª¬π as shown in Figure A below. Find the time taken for point P to move to P`. Show your working. (2 marks)**


![Wave Problem](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Interference14.2.png)

$$ v = \frac{\lambda}{T} $$


$$ T = \frac{\lambda}{v} $$


$$T = \frac{0.80}{80} $$


$$T = 0.01 $$


$$ \text{time taken } = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.01 = 0.005 \; \text{s} $$




---


Point **P to P‚Ä≤** represents **half the time** it takes for one complete wave cycle (**T**). 
To find this duration, we must first calculate the **period** using the wave equation, and then **divide it by two**.


>‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The point **P** does **not move horizontally**. The question is asking for the **time it takes for the *same point***‚Äîstarting at **zero displacement**‚Äîto move **up** and then come **back down** again.`

## Wave phenomenons


### ***Interference***


**Interference** describes what happens when two waves approach or meet each other. 
Unlike particles, which might collide or bounce off each other, **waves undergo superposition**‚Äîthis means their **amplitudes are added together** when they overlap.


This leads to two possible outcomes:


### üîπ Constructive Interference

Occurs when two wave pulses are **in phase** (peaks align with peaks, troughs with troughs), resulting in a **larger wave pulse** with greater amplitude.

### üîπ Destructive Interference

Occurs when two wave pulses are **out of phase** (a peak overlaps with a trough), resulting in **partial or complete cancellation**.

### ***Standing Waves***


Imagine you're holding one end of a rope or slinky, and your friend is holding the other. You start shaking your end up and down, experimenting with different speeds. At certain frequencies, something interesting happens, the wave seems to "settle" into a steady pattern that **just feels right**. The rope looks like it's standing still in some parts and waving in others.


What you‚Äôre seeing is a **standing wave**:
> A stable wave pattern created when two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travel in **opposite directions** and **interfere** with each other. 


When a string is plucked, it doesn‚Äôt just vibrate at a single frequency ‚Äî instead, it vibrates at **multiple frequencies** at the same time. These frequencies are called **harmonics**, and they all combine to produce the **rich sound** you hear.


![Harmonics](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Harmonics.png)



In general, for the $ \text{n}^\text{th} $ harmonic:


- The wavelength is given by: 
 $$
   \boldsymbol{\lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}}
 $$
- The frequency is: 
 $$
   \boldsymbol{f_n = \frac{nv}{2L}}
 $$




---


### ***Resonance***
> **Resonance** occurs when an **external vibrating force** causes another system nearby to **vibrate with a much greater amplitude**. 
> This happens when the frequency of the external force **matches the natural frequency** of the object being affected.


A famous example is:
- **Breaking a wine glass with your voice** ‚Äî if you sing a note that perfectly matches the glass‚Äôs natural frequency, it **shatters** due to large amplitude oscillations.

<br>


Let's consider a problem below


<br>


**e.g 2. An experiment is conducted to observe standing waves on a string that is 8.0 meters long and fixed at both ends. Wave pulses travel along the string at a constant speed of 30 m s‚Åª¬π.**


![Standing Wave Problem](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Interference11.1.png)


**a) In one experiment, a continuous transverse wave with a frequency of 8 Hz is generated. Will a standing wave be formed? Justify your answer with calculations. (3 marks)**


$$v = f \lambda $$ \
$$30 = 8 \lambda $$ \
$$\lambda = 3.75 $$


$$\text{Standing waves form when } L = \frac{n\lambda}{2} \; \text{where n is an integer.} $$


$$8.0 = \frac{n \times 3.75}{2} $$ \
$$\therefore \; n = 4.26... \; \text{and a standing wave will not form.} $$


---


**Standing waves** only form at certain **frequencies** and **wavelengths** ‚Äî specifically, when an **integer number of half-wavelengths** can fit perfectly within the length of the string. Hence, a wave with a wavelength of **3.75 m** will **clearly not** form a standing wave on a string that is **8.0 m** long as it doesn't perfectly fit within it.


>‚ö†Ô∏è **Note :** The **wave speed** remains **the same for all harmonics** on a string




What changes between harmonics is:
- The **wavelength** (shorter for higher harmonics)
- The **frequency** (higher for higher harmonics)


But the speed $ v = f \lambda $ remains constant.






---


<br>


**b) Determine which harmonic would be formed if the string is driven at a frequency of 1.875 Hz. Then, on Figure A above, sketch the standing wave pattern that would be produced on the string. (2 marks)**


$$v = f \lambda $$ \
$$30 = 1.875 \lambda$$ \
$$\lambda = 16 $$


$$8.0 = \frac{n \times 16}{2} $$ \
$$\therefore \; n = 1$$


![Standing Wave Problem](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/solution_media/Interference11.1A.png)




---


We determine the harmonic by checking whether the wave of **wavelength 16‚ÄØm** fits perfectly within the **8‚ÄØm** string. 
Since **half of the wavelength** matches the string length exactly, this configuration corresponds to the **first harmonic**.


---


### ***Diffraction***
> **Diffraction** is the phenomenon where waves **spread out** as they pass through a **gap** or move **around an obstacle**. 
> The extent of diffraction depends on the **wavelength of the wave** and the **size of the gap or object**.


Significant diffraction occurs when the ratio:


$$
\boldsymbol{\frac{\lambda}{\text{w}} > 1}
$$


That is, when the **wavelength is comparable to or larger than the gap**, the wave spreads out more noticeably.


In a **single-slit experiment**, you might expect to see just **one central bright band** on the screen. However, what is actually observed is a **distinct pattern of alternating bright and dark regions** ‚Äî a **diffraction pattern**.


This pattern can **only be explained if light behaves like a wave**. As light passes through the narrow slit, it **spreads out** (diffracts), and the wavelets **interfere** with each other.

This provides strong evidence for the **wave-like nature of light**.


---




## Young's Double Slit Experiment


In a **double-slit experiment**, the **particle model** predicts that light travels straight through the two slits, producing **two bright bands** on the screen. However, what we actually observe is a **pattern of alternating bright and dark fringes** ‚Äî an **interference pattern**.


This provides strong evidence for the **wave nature of light**, as it can only be explained by the principle of **interference**:


- **Bright fringes** occur when the **path difference** between the two waves is: 
 $$
   \boldsymbol{\text{p.d} = n\lambda}
 $$
- **Dark fringes** occur when the path difference is: 
 $$
   \boldsymbol{\text{p.d} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda}
 $$
 where **$ n $ is the band from the centre integer (0, 1, 2, 3...)** and **path difference = $ |S_1P - S_2P| $**


---


###  Fringe Spacing


The spacing between consecutive bright fringes, denoted as $ \Delta x $, depends on:


$$
\boldsymbol{\Delta x = \frac{\lambda L}{d}}
$$


Where:
- $ \lambda $ = wavelength of light (m)
- $ L $ = distance from the slits to the screen (m)
- $ d $ = distance between the two slits (m)


---


<br>


Let's consider the problem below.


<br>


**Physics students studying the phenomenon of interference set up a Young's double slit experiment using a red light source as shown in Figure A below.**


![Young's Experiment](https://vceproblems.s3.amazonaws.com/question_media/Interference4.2.png)


**a) Explain why the point C directly at the centre is a bright band rather than a dark band. (2 marks)**


***Point C is a bright band because the path difference is 0, resulting in constructive interference where p.d = $n\lambda$. Dark bands, which result from destructive interference occur when their path difference is an odd multiple of half the wavelength.***


---


<br>


**b) Determine the wavelength of the red light source. Show your working.(3 marks)**


$$\Delta x = \frac{\lambda L}{d} $$ \
$$\lambda = \frac{\Delta x d}{L} $$


$$\Delta x = \frac{1.40\times 10^{-2}}{3} $$ \
$$\Delta x = 0.0046... $$


$$\lambda = \frac{0.0046... \times 20.0 \times 10^{-6}}{0.15} $$ \
$$\lambda = 6.2 \times 10^{-7} \; \text{m} $$


---


Here, we use the **fringe spacing formula.**  However, instead of directly using the total distance to the third bright fringe (B‚ÇÉ), remember that **Œîx** represents the distance between **consecutive bright fringes**.


So, if the total distance from the central maximum (C) to the **third bright fringe (B‚ÇÉ)** is 1.40 $\times $ 10$^{-2} $, then the value of $ \Delta x $ is $ \frac{1.40 \times 10^{-2}}{3} $.


---


<br>


**c) Determine the distance S‚ÇÅB‚ÇÇ if the distance S‚ÇÇB‚ÇÇ = 3.0 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∂ m. Show your working. (2 marks)**


$$ p.d = S_2B_2 - S_1B_2 $$


$$ 2 \lambda = S_2B_2 - S_1B_2 $$


$$ 2 \times 6.2... \times 10^{-7} = 3.0 \times 10^{-6} - S_1B_2 $$


$$ S_1B_2 = 1.76 \times 10^{-6} \; \text{m} $$


---
Since B‚ÇÇ corresponds to the **second bright fringe** from the centre, we have p.d $= 2\lambda $


$ \lambda $ is the wavelength **calculated in part b)**, so we substitute that value into the equation to find $S_1B_2$.

## Conclusion for Light as a Wave


To understand light as a wave, we first needed to grasp the basic properties of waves. Waves are described using key terms such as **wavelength (Œª)**, **frequency (f)**, and **period (T)**, providing the **wave equation**: 
$$
v = f\lambda
$$


From this foundation, we observe several important **wave phenomena**:


- **Interference**
  - **Constructive interference** (amplitudes reinforce each other)
  - **Destructive interference** (amplitudes cancel out)
 - **Standing waves** (waves of the same frequency travel in opposite directions and interfere)


- **Resonance** (external force vibrating a system at its natural frequency)


- **Diffraction** (spreading of waves)


The **wave model of light** is strongly supported by **Yong's double-slit experiment**. If light were purely a stream of particles, we would expect only two bright spots behind the slits. However, what is observed is a pattern of alternating **bright and dark fringes** where it can only be explained by constructive interference (p.d = $ n\lambda$) and destructive interference (p.d = $ \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right)\lambda$) respectively.
