      <h1>How to Use Chuba Effectively</h1>

      <p>
        There are three main sections for each subject on Chuba:
      </p>

      <h2>1. Summaries</h2>
      <p>
        This is a place to review summary content, which I highly suggest you look at if you're not sure about something or don't fully grasp the idea yet.
        Although the summaries are short, everything written there is intentional – avoiding ambiguity and unnecessary information, while focusing on what’s actually important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, not everything is included here, as I didn’t want these summaries to become as long as textbook chapters. It’s best to use and reference both your textbooks for introductory ideas and then come back to these summaries to understand which parts, topics, and skills are actually important and frequently tested.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Practice Questions</h2>
      <p>
        After reviewing the summaries, try out some practice questions and check the solutions. Don’t just check if you got the answer correct, but also see if you can learn anything from the working out or step-by-step solutions.
        Your process may differ in some cases, so choose the method that works best for you.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Practice SACs</h2>
      <p>
        As you approach SAC time, have a go at some practice SACs covering content from the area of study. Keep in mind that your school’s SAC structure may differ, but it’s still a great practice to attempt them, even under timed conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aim to set yourself a time limit of about 1.25 times the number of marks for the SAC, since the marks vary for each generated SAC.
