However, if this step significantly increases deployment time and early detection is not critical for your workflow, you may remove this section to streamline the deployment process.

      # üö´ Opting Out of Oryx Build
      # If you prefer to disable the Oryx build process during deployment, follow these steps:
      # 1. Remove the SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT app setting from your Azure App Service Environment variables.
      # 2. Refer to sample workflows for alternative deployment strategies: https://github.com/Azure/actions-workflow-samples/tree/master/AppService
